Design a simulation for a card game. This game is playable by 2 or more players and 
consists of a series of rounds until a single player is determined to be the winner. 
Each round consists of four phases performed in order: shuffle, deal, exchange, and score.
- *shuffle*: randomize the order of the a deck of 52 playing cards
- *deal*: from the top of the deck, give each player 5 cards
- *exchange*: each player, may discard as many cards (face down) as they would like. After
they have discarded their cards, draw cards from the top of the deck until the player has 
5 cards in their hand.
- *score*: determine which player has the highest numerical value of cards in their hand
(face cards are worth 10 points each). If exactly one player has the highest combined value,
then that player is declared the winner of the round and they earn 1 point.

Aside from the point scored by the winning player in a round, no other state is carried 
over between rounds. The first player to achieve 10 points is declared the winner of the
game. (edited) 
There's probably a higher level of specificity that could be provided, but I think 
writing up a one-pager, providing that to the candidate, and maybe even playing a single 
round with a real deck to demonstrate the rules would be really valuable in overcoming 
that mental roadblock.
